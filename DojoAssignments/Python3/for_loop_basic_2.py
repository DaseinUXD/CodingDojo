# For Loop Basic II
# Objectives
# Get comfortable writing functions only using basic building blocks of Python (we want you to gain confidence in your
#  ability to write custom functions instead of relying too heavily on advanced built in python functions
# Get comfortable using for loops, functions, lists, and other data types
#
# Biggie Size - Given an array, write a function that changes all positive numbers in the array to "big".
#     Example: makeItBig([-1, 3, 5, -5]) returns that same array, changed to [-1, "big", "big", -5].
def biggie_size(array):
    for i in array:
        if i > 0:
            i = "Big"
    return

biggie_size([-1,3,5,-5])

# Count Positives - Given an array of numbers, create a function to replace last value with number of positive values.
#   Example, countPositives([-1,1,1,1]) changes array to [-1,1,1,3] and returns it.  (Note that zero is not considered to b a positive number).
# SumTotal - Create a function that takes an array as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in the array.
#   For example sumTotal([1,2,3,4]) should return 10
# Average - Create a function that takes an array as an argument and returns the average of all the values in the array.
#   For example multiples([1,2,3,4]) should return 2.5
# Length - Create a function that takes an array as an argument and returns the length of the array.
#   For example length([1,2,3,4]) should return 4
# Minimum - Create a function that takes an array as an argument and returns the minimum value in the array.
#   If the passed array is empty, have the function return false.
#     For example minimum([1,2,3,4]) should return 1; minimum([-1,-2,-3]) should return -3.
# Maximum - Create a function that takes an array as an argument and returns the maximum value in the array.
#   If the passed array is empty, have the function return false.
#   For example maximum([1,2,3,4]) should return 4; maximum([-1,-2,-3]) should return -3.
# UltimateAnalyze - Create a function that takes an array as an argument and returns a dictionary that has the
#  sumTotal, average, minimum, maximum and length of the array.
# ReverseList - Create a function that takes an array as an argument and return an array in a reversed order.
#   Do this without creating an empty temporary array.
#   For example reverse([1,2,3,4]) should return [4,3,2,1].
#   This challenge is known to appear during basic technical interviews.
