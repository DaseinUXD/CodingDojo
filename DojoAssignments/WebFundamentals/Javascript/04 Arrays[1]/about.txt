Overview
    In this chapter, we explore the array data structure: reading, changing, as well as adding and removing elements
    (which change the array’s length). Before chapter’s end, we touch upon associative arrays as well. At this point
     we expect you to quickly complete the 13 mandatory algorithm challenges. Building array-based functions such as
      min(), max(), sum() and average() should be easy and rapid.
