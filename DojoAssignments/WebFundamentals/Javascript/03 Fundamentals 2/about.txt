Overview
    This chapter, we review basic blocks of programming: conditionals, logic operators, loops and a few techniques.
    All of the following concepts are used in this chapter:

        Variables
        Functions
        for loops
        while loops
        Conditional (if/else) statements
        console.log
        Parameters
        Return values
        Math.random | Math.ceil | Math.floor | Math.trunc
Review: define variable. Think of it as simply an empty container with a label. Once you put a value into the container,
you can refer to this value by the label. We put a value into a variable using single-equals (=), which you read as
"is set to a value of". In other words, var name = "Zaphod" can be read as Variable labeled "name" is set to a value of
"Zaphod". After this line of code, when you refer to "name", you get a value of "Zaphod". If you are still getting used
to the idea of variables, don't panic.
